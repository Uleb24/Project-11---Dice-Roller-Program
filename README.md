# Project-11---Dice-Roller-Program
I created a program that rolls dice...

You can choose the number of dice to roll and it will role random dice with said number of dice !

This was a more complex but still beginner level project as the code uses really basic syntax. 

See you in Project 12 ! (Reminder that this is part of my beginner PYTHON projects, other more complex projects will come out as I IMPROVE ;) ) (Staying true to my status)
